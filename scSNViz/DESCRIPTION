Version: 1.0.0
Maintainer: Tushar Sharma <tushar2016sharma@gmail.com>
Description: scSNViz is an open-source software developed in R that leverages existing R packages for the processing of single-cell gene and SNV transcriptomics data while introducing novel features for analysis and visualization of scSNVs. scSNViz aims to enable users to explore and interpret SNV-related cellular heterogeneity and facilitate the integration of SNV information into existing scRNA-seq analytical workflows.
